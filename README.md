# Español Everyday

I suck at Spanish, and though my grades may be enough to scrape by, the sleepless nights spent pondering Sra. Bajaj's disappointed sighs towards mis abilidades will haunt me forever if I don't do something about it.

So, I'm doing something about it! Hopefully, Español Everday will be a Chrome Extension which turns my new tab page into a daily collection of Spanish words/phrases, and gamifies it to trick me into learning Spanish. Because, hey, what's more fun than that?
